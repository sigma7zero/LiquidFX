# LiquidFX
LiquidFX is a Blender \ Armory3D node that facilitates a simple animated liquid surface using a PBR workflow.
It is free for all purposes - MIT License. The node currently works with the latest Armory3D version of Blender 2.8, but will not work with the Eevee rendering engine. Maybe this will change in time? Also note, that Armory3D and Blender 2.8 are in the early stages of development. Many of the blender object nodes (like Fresnel) are not compatible with Armory3D yet. I can't add more features until they are.

Cheers,
