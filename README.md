# LiquidFX
LiquidFX is a Blender \ Armory3D node that facilitates a simple animated liquid surface using a PBR workflow
It is free for all purposes. The node currently works with the latest Armory3D version of Blender 2.8, but will not work with the Eevee rendering engine. Maybe this will change in time?
